Build a modern, responsive single-page web app named StudyMate, designed to help college students study smarter and prepare for corporate job interviews.
The app should use AI to convert class notes, PDFs, or text input into quizzes, flashcards, and summaries, and provide interview prep assistance (common HR, technical, and aptitude questions).

Core Features
📝 1. Upload or Paste Notes

Allow students to upload PDFs / Word / Text files or paste text directly.

AI should parse the content and generate study materials.

🧩 2. AI Quiz & Flashcard Generator

Automatically create quizzes (MCQs, short answers, or true/false) from uploaded notes.

Create AI flashcards (Question on front, Answer on back).

Allow export of flashcards as .csv or .pdf.

🧠 3. Smart Summaries

Generate concise, AI-driven summaries of uploaded material.

Allow students to select “Quick Recap” or “Detailed Review.”

💼 4. Interview Preparation Mode

Preloaded corporate interview question banks:

General HR questions

Technical (by domain: IT, Finance, Marketing, etc.)

Aptitude & reasoning

AI should analyze uploaded resume (optional) and suggest personalized interview questions.

📊 5. Progress Tracker

Simple visual analytics dashboard:

Number of quizzes attempted

Weak topic areas (based on quiz performance)

Suggested improvement areas.

💬 6. AI Chat Assistant

Integrated chatbox: “Ask StudyMate” for any question based on uploaded content.

Supports follow-up questions and rephrased explanations.

🎨 7. UI & UX Requirements

Modern single-page layout using React.js (or Next.js) + Tailwind CSS.

Include icons & light animations (Framer Motion preferred).
